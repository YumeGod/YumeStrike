Well... this is unfortunate. The above exception is a failure when the team
server tries to encrypt communication destined for your Beacon. If the key
is not NULL [the above message will say (null) if it is] then we may have
hit a bug in Cobalt Strike or within Java itself. That's no fun!

The good news? Restart your team server and you will be able to control your
Beacons again. The bad news? I still have no idea what's causing this. If
you could report this message [the stacktrace above helps!] and send the
contents of debug.txt to support@strategiccyber.com. I'd greatly appreciate
it.
